                <li><strong>On Getting There:</strong>&nbsp;Navigating to Keystone Ranch can be somewhat tricky, as simply navigating on your phone may lead you to roads that are active for the golf course in the summer, but closed in the winter. We highly suggest that if you are driving yourself, give yourself some extra time to arrive, and that you take the directions in the map linked above.</li>
                <li><strong>On-Resort transporation is provided!</strong>&nbsp;Keystone Resort conveniently offers free shuttling around the resort. For the wedding, a dedicated shuttle will be available for guests to get to and from the wedding. More information on this will be provided as it becomes available.</li>

            <li><strong>***Please Note: </strong> It will be snowy, and cold. It is encouraged to wear winter boots to the event, and change footwear there. There will be a coat room available.</li>

    <div class="four columns detail-element">
      <h4 class="text-center">By Plane</h4>
      <p>The closest and most convenient airport to the wedding location will be Denver International Airport. If you need to grab a hotel room the night after you arrive, or before you leave, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flydenver.com/traveler_services/hotels">here</a> is a list to access those.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="four columns detail-element">
      <h4 class="text-center">By Shuttle</h4>
      <p>Our guests will have access to discounted transportation to Keystone Resort through <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coloradomountainexpress.com/">Colorado Mountain Express</a>. This is a shuttle that can pick up from Denver International airport and bring you directly to the resort. To access the discount, please contact CME and use the code <strong>GO4DIE</strong>. We highly encourage shuttle to and from DIA to avoid driving on the potentially snowy mountain roads, and this service also allows room for skiis/boards if you have them!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="four columns detail-element">
      <h4 class="text-center">While Here</h4>
      <p>Once at Keystone, getting around is easy. Free shuttle buses run daily throughout the Keystone Resort as well as surrounding ski areas. See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.keystoneresort.com/plan-a-vacation/transportation-schedule-and-parking.aspx#/GettingAround">here</a> to access schedules for Keystone, and <a target="_blank" href="http://summitcountyco.gov/586/Transit-Summit-Stage/?cmpid=ET7217064&cmpid=ET7878642_KY_REU_1_FY17">Check out these schedules</a> to explore summit county and the surrounding resorts.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center">Staying Here</h4>
      <p>Discounted Lodging is available for our guests through Keystone Resort. To look at rates/availability, please visit <a target="_blank" href="https://gc.synxis.com/rez.aspx?Hotel=40076&Chain=6521&start=availresults&arrive=12/17/2017&depart=12/18/2017&adult=1&child=0&group=GO4DIE">this link</a>, or call <a href="tel:888-273-2502">888-273-2502</a>. This is a great option because you are right on the resort and won't have to worry about logistics.</p>
      <p>However, being that Keystone is a ski town, we also suggest that guests also look into <a target="_blank" href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Keystone--CO--United-States?guests=2&place_id=ChIJg2V85yRXaocRYfovfYgMZ0M&checkin=12%2F16%2F2017&checkout=12%2F18%2F2017&ss_id=coc8kltt&source=bb&page=1&allow_override%5B%5D=&s_tag=8n6KaoZf">Air BNB</a> for a variety of lodging options to accomodate small and large groups at a reasonable cost, often times with access to a kitchen. A potential downside is Air BNB rentals may not be as convenient to public transportation, but Steve and I have not experienced that before. Just remember to keep that in mind when searching and booking.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center">A word about altitude...</h4>
      <p>
        Whether you're a 2:45:04 marathon runner or a couch potato we want you to know that altitude sickness is real and statistically will affect a small number of our guests. Most folks experience at least a little discomfort until they acclimate to the altitude. <a href="http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/tc/altitude-sickness-topic-overview#1">Here</a> is an WebMD article which details how to deal with altitude, but in summary: stay hydrated, be cautious with alcohol, eat well, and take it easy on physical exertion to allow your body to acclimate. (We're not kidding about easing into exercise, you fitness freaks!)
      </p>
      <p>
        Being affected by altitude is never fun, but most cases are very temporary - like an annoying hangover. The best you can do is <strong>rest, stay hydrated, ease up on alcohol and heavy foods, and stay positive</strong>. You'll be feeling yourself again after a good night sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        One more reminder: It will get cold! That sounds obvious, but we are serious. Please remember to dress appropriately to keep yourself comfortable and safe. One phrase we like to remember is "The heat is all in the sun." If the sun is out, there is a good chance that it will be warmer out. However, temperatures drop dramatically when it sets.
